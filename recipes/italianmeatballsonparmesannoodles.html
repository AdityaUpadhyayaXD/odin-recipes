        <h2>Decscription</h2>
        <p>Baked Italian meatballs served over garlic Parmesan noodles. They're so good, and despite the long list of ingredients, most are seasonings, so they are not difficult to make.</p>
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
            <lI>1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for baking</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon minced garlic or garlic paste</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <Li>1 large egg, beaten</Li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups beef broth, divided, or more as needed</li>
            <Li>1 pound 80% lean ground beef</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (225 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan, parsley, oregano, garlic, salt, black pepper, basil, and red pepper flakes in a bowl and mix together with a fork. Stir in egg, milk, and 1/4 cup beef broth. Add ground beef and stir with a fork just until combined.</li>
            <li>With wet hands, roll meat mixture into medium-sized balls and place in a large casserole dish. Pour in 1 cup beef broth, or enough to fill the casserole 1/4 inch deep. Sprinkle meatballs with Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake meatballs in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn meatballs over, and bake until no longer pink at the center, about 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>For noodles, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook until tender with a bite, about 10 minutes; drain.  </li>
            <li>Place noodles in a bowl and immediately add butter, garlic paste, Parmesan, oil, black pepper, and parsley. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Remove meatballs from the oven. To serve, spoon noodles onto a plate and top with meatballs. Sprinkle with more parsley. Enjoy!</li>
